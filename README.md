# Descripition
 This repository contains a dataset and analysis related to suicide rates across various countries from 1987 to 2015. The primary goal of this project is to explore different countries' suicide data, represent them graphically, and find the mean and maximum values of the suicide data.
 
 # Features 
 - This repository contains only unique values.
 - NaN values in the dataset are treated as 0.
 - Suicide data for each age group is represented using various graph types, including bar plots, scatter plots, and stem plots.
 - Comparison of suicide ratios between males and females.

# Lesson learned 
 In this project, I learned several new things, such as:
 # How to handle and replace NaN values.
 # How to create subplots to compare data between two values.
 # Calculating unique values in a CSV file.
 # Finding the maximum value using the ` idxmax() ` method and the minimum value using the ` idxmin() ` method.
 # Summing null values using the ` isnull() ` method.
